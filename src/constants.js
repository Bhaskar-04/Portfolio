Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas. Learn more about how to use
Kaboom.js by watching some of my tutorials <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">here</a>.`,

I probably only read one of them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
